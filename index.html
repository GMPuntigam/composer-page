                <p>I was born 1996 in Cologne and was introduced to music by my parents at an early age. I took some piano lessons in elementary school but never got far as a pianist.
                Later I discovered the trumpet and fell in love with the instrument quickly. As a teenager I tried myself at composing music. Since then I have been improving constantly.
                I mainly write music for wind orchestra and brass band.</p>
